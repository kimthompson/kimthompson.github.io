# My Website

I originally generated this with Nuxt as an experiment, but that was overkill for this. Then I attended Lemon's Minnebar 2019 presentation on shrinking your website and Ross Kaffenberger's RailsConf 2019 presentation on PWAs and decided to make this splash page as tiny as possible.

Also I paid Lady Red (TODO: Link to Instagram) for a cute sketch of me to use as an avatar/on my cards/on this site instead of the weird headshot I had before.

Color scheme, as always, putzed around with with Coolors.com.
