# My Website

I originally generated this with Nuxt as an experiment, but that seemed like overkill for this site. Then I attended [Lemon](https://ahoylemon.xyz/)'s Minnebar 2019 presentation on shrinking your website and Ross Kaffenberger's RailsConf 2019 presentation on PWAs and decided to make this splash page as tiny as possible.

This is a WIP: the design and architecture are done, but now I want to really understand PWAs and optimization on a basic level and get Lighthouse passing at > 90%.

The avatar was done by [Lady Red](https://www.instagram.com/lady_red_art/?hl=en). Her stuff is awesome, and you should check her out!
