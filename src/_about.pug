    h2 About Me
    p Iâ€™m a software developer and writer who has been living and working in the Twin Cities since I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2015. I'm a generalist with experience making applications for web, Windows and iOS. I currently make web apps for Minnesota Public Radio, and I'm starting to dabble in video essay production.
