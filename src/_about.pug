    h2 About Me
    aside Iâ€™m a software developer who has been living and working in the Twin Cities since I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2015. I'm a generalist with experience making applications for web, Windows and iOS. I currently make web apps for Minnesota Public Radio. I hope to post my side projects here, and I hope to actually start blogging.
